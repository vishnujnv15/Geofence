# Geofence
MapApp //is the App name
The geofence api used here takes the point & a polygon for checking,
So, a polygon of 12 sides was used to create geofence.
But the api does not shows geofence, for that Mapview.polygon was used.
The radius of the geofence is given in miles

The location should be turned on before to point to our current location
If not true, a notification is fired to turn it on by user.
